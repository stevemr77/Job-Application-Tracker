# My Job Application Tracker
Welcome to my job application tracking app! 

## Summary

My Job Application Tracker helps you keep track of the many job applications you may be completing soon. Users can signup/login with nothing else but a username. Once logged in users can complete the job application form which will display below the form. Users can add as many applications as they would like to track. Once you are done tracking an application, users can discard it by pressing the red 'X' button on each application. 

I drew inspiration for this project by the overall sentiment from everyone in my cohort at Flatiron school as we enter our Capstone projects phase and approach the job search. 

## Technologies

React.js with Hooks

## Setup

Fork and clone this repo along with the [backend](https://github.com/stevemr77/Job-Application-Tracker-Backend). First, setup the backend: in the backend folder run `bundle install` to install all dependencies and run `rails server` to get the server started.

Now, set up the frontend: while in the frontend folder run `npm install` and afterwards `npm start`.

## Features

* Create new users in the backend
* Enter a new application by completing the form which creates a new entry in the database.
